# Ethical and Legal Framework

The Ethical and Legal framework of B3Africa project aims to establish the bases for a controlled and regulated data management inside the B3Africa informatics platform (eB3Kit) and when using the eB3Kit in a distributed environment where data can be shared among eB3Kit instances. This framework is focus on safeguarding the personal autonomy of sample donor, data subjects or research subject. 
Due to the complex legal landscape, a general strategy to develope a realistic and functional legal framework was designed. The whole framework is based in two basic notions that can be considered universally accepted: 
- The need for informed consent
- The ethical approval to allow a safe and legitimate handling of biological samples and data within research 

## Informed Consent
The possibility for any person providing human biological samples and associated data to be used for health care or research purposes, to give his or her consent to the procedures to be conducted. The person, or when applicable, his or her legal representative, should in beforehand be given appropriate information as to the purpose and nature of the procedures conducted, as well as on its consequences and risks. The person may freely withdraw consent at any time.
Limited and proportionate exceptions may be accepted where appropriate, after an approval by an Ethical Review Board.

## Ethical Approval
The ethical approval is a decision taken by an organ consisting of ethical and legal experts and lay individuals (in Africa, this person (s) can also be religious representative) that has been authorized to review and approve research study from an ethical point of view.

# Model Data Management Policy (MDMP)
the MDMP is intended to be implemented in the eB3Kit as part of the govenrance system for using this platform and will pave the way for managing the use of the eB3Kit in control and regulated environments beyond the projectâ€™s life time. 

## Policy Principles
- Based on common standards regarding informed consent and ethical approval. The definition of the concepts will be determined by the applicable law on site. If the applicable law does not regulate these issues, the minimum requirements (section 4.1) will be applied. For all the European users it will be based on the EU Data Protection Directive 
- Compatible with the stated purpose of the B3Africa platform 
- Aims to ensure that the platform meets its obligations towards its stakeholders 
- Facilitate and ensure secure and high quality services for data storage, analysis and sharing
- Clearly specify what data can be stored, analysed and accessed
- Clearly specify what data will NOT be stored, analysed or accessed
## Policy elements
### Platform Adoption Procedure
- Organization Application
- Individual Membership Application
- Storage and Analysis Services Request

### Evaluation of Requests
- Selection criteria for organization acceptance
- Selection criteria for individual membership
- Selection criteria for data store and analysis
- Suggested standard forms to be designed by the platform

The final version of the ethical and legal framework together with the MDMP will be provided at the en of the project.
